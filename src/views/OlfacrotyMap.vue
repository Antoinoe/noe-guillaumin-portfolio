                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <h4>A. Context & Previous Work</h4>
                <p>When I first arrived at the <a class="link" href="https://ift.devinci.fr" target="_blank">IFT</a>, I
                    met <a class="link" href="https://ift.devinci.fr/member/romain-manoilov3" target="_blank">Romain
                        Manoilov</a>, a student who worked on a device called the <a class="link"
                        href="https://ift.devinci.fr/augmented-olfactory-interface-for-telepresence-in-metaverse"
                        target="_blank">"Olfactory Interface"</a> that can provide diverse scents to a mobile user.
                    At the same time, the VR project <a href="https://ift.devinci.fr/projects/doppelmarsh-2022"
                        target="_blank">Doppelmarsh</a> caught my attention, and we wanted to implement his
                    project into the VR application.
                </p>
                <p><a href="https://ift.devinci.fr/projects/doppelmarsh-2022" target="_blank">Doppelmarsh</a> is a
                    project that was conducted by the MIT Media Lab in 2014. Based on <a
                        href="https://tidmarsh.media.mit.edu" target="_blank">Tidmarsh</a>, they
                    recreated a marsh that exists in real life to observe in VR how the terrain would heal over decades
                    of overfarming.</p><br>
                <p>The objective of the project was to deliver a scent to the user based on its position in the VR
                    application.
                    To detect the player position, we used the unity box colliders. A box collider is an invisible box
                    that detects when a specific object enters,
                    stays, or leave. For the demonstration, a smellbox is linked to a scent and an
                    intensity. <i>(eg: type="Forest", intensity=0.5)</i> The results show an improve of the sensation of
                    telepresence inside VR applications.</p>
                <figure class="simpleColliderBox">
                    <img src="/img/simple_collixer_box_labeled.webp" alt="A box collider inside the unity software">
                    <figcaption class="captionText">A box collider inside the unity software, linked to a scent and an
                        intensity.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h4>B. Limitation</h4>
                <p>While the solution works on a small open area for a demo, it becomes clear that this cannot be
                    applied to an application with a large terrain, with more scents.</p>
                <p>Why? In our previous experiment, une collider box = one scent and its intensity. On a larger project,
                    with way more scents diversity, and the necessity to have a graduate scent's intensity curve,
                    collider boxes become harder to manage. </p>
                <figure class="combinedColliderBox">
                    <img src="/img/terrain_up_all_combined_collider_boxes.webp"
                        alt="The map from the top-view with the collider boxes for each scents. (blue : water, green : forest, orange : marsh)">
                    <figcaption class="captionText">The Unity terrain from the top-view with the collider boxes for each
                        scents.

                        water, green : forest, orange : marsh)</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The image above illustrates how cluttered the scene can get as more scent are added. Note that
                    it shows the box colliders as if the intensity were always set to maximum. To create a gradual
                    intensity, we need to add multiple box colliders with lower intensity values to form a kind of
                    gradient. The smoother and more precise you want the scent intensity to be, the more colliders
                    you'll need, and the messier the scene becomes.</p>
                <p>On a small terrain with a few scents, it's still managable, but our terrain here is 512mÂ². I wanted
                    to find a way for developers to easily implement, manage, and scale projects that include olfactory
                    feedback across large, open, and complex environments.</p>
                <h4>C. Texture-based olfactory data</h4>
                <p>One possible solution is to use a texture-based approach.</p>
                <p>Instead of using collider boxes, we use a top-down view of the terrain and paint on separate layers.
                    Each layer is a texture that represents a specific scent. The transparency <i>(alpha)</i> value of each
                    pixel defines the intensity of that scent at the corresponding position on the terrain.</p>
                <p>This allow for better development of feature including olfactory feedback,</p>
                <p>The 2DOlfactory Map represents each scent as a 2D texture, where the alpha channel defines its
                    intensity. These textures are scaled to the terrain, allowing smooth and precise scent transitions.
                    Each scent has its own texture, making it easy to layer and combine multiple scents.</p>
                <p>
                    The process involves two steps: creating the scent textures in external tools, then importing them
                    into Unity for real-time interaction. At runtime, the system reads the alpha value at the player's
                    position and adjusts the olfactory device accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This method offers better precision, flexibility, and scalability than traditional approaches.
                    Although limited to static terrains, it provides a solid foundation for immersive experiences by
                    syncing scents with visuals.

                <h3>2. Implementation</h3>
                <h4>A. How to make a texture</h4>
                <p>
                    Any drawing software that handle alpha will do it. For this project, the texture were made on
                    Photoshop.
                </p><br>
                <p>The steps are quite simple : </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a screenshot of the top view of your terrain in your game engine.</li>
                    <li>Open your drawing software, and create a squared shape canvas <i>(eg. 1024*1024)</i>. Be careful
                        though, don't create a texture too large, or you might experience performance issues.</li>
                    <li>Place the screenshot of your terrain on your drawing software to determine where to draw.</li>
                    <li>Start drawing. This is the fun part. Any color will do. The most important thing is to know
                        how you want to draw your transparency. Try multiple brushes to see how they affect your
                        drawing. <br>
                        You might want to be careful because if your texture and your terrain is for example 512*512, a
                        pixel
                        length is equal to one meter, so your drawing should be precise depending on your needs.</li>
                    <li>Before exporting your texture, you want to check if there are "mistakes" in your drawing.
                        Try to put a black-colored layer under your drawing to see how your alpha is. I personally got
                        some
                        bad surprises where some regions were not correctly drawn.</li>
                    <li>To avoid any rescale of your canvas when exporting, you might want to take your drawing
                        tool and set its alpha to 1%. Then, draw a point at each corner of your canvas.</li>
                    <li>Hide all layer except your olfactory texture and export it as a .png file.</li>
                    <li>Your texture is ready. We'll now see how to read it in Unity, and then how to send the data
                        to the Olfactory Interface.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>B. Read data</h4>
                <p><b>Note : The project is available on <a href="https://github.com/Antoinoe/2D-Olfactory-Map"

                <p>We need several informations : </p>
                <ul class="dashed">
                    <li>how many scent are available?</li>
                    <li>what are the size of the textures?</li>
                    <li>the player's position</li>
                    <li>the delay between each requests <i>(you don't want to read all of your textures 60 times per second, but
                    maybe once or twice every 10 seconds)</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You want to have a structure that looks like this :</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The <b><i>ScentTexReader.cs</i></b> script stores a list of the textures and their corresponding
                    scent and intensity.
                    When triggered <i>(by the script I'll explain in the next part)</i>, it takes the position of the user in
                    Unity, and map it to each textures. Then, it retrieves the alpha of the pixel on the texture and set
                    it to the intensity value OlfactoryData struct.</p>
                <h4>C. Communication to the device</h4>
                <p>The Olfactory Interface is using an ESP microcontroller. To communicate between the ESP and Unity, we
                    can use the <a
